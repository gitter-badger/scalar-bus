Introduction: Nemesis is proposed to be a hyper grade computing environment that can parse the entropy of change and direction of a particular set of responses from various sources through pluggable webhooks to other platforms and advice workarounds and solutions to certain problems the complexity of which tends to increase according to a threshold that would be provided by the user as an action mapped to pre-defined complexities or self-defined action to complexity maps, at all times if the user provides no actions or maps to recieve workarounds and solutions the system would define an exponential complexity.
